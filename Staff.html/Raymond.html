    <p>I'm Raymond Zhu, a 17-year-old with a burning passion for table tennis. While I haven't yet had the chance to represent my country on the national stage, I believe that my relentless work ethic will propel me to the Under 17 National Team next year. My journey in table tennis has been defined by determination and perseverance. I've poured countless hours into practice, honing my skills and sharpening my game. The dream of wearing the national colors is what keeps me going, and I'm determined to make it a reality.
