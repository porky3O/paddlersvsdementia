    <p>I'm Victor Xie, a 17-year-old with a passion for table tennis that's been burning bright since I was a kid. Currently, I'm proud to be a part of the Under 17 National Team, representing my country in a sport that I love. My journey in table tennis has been marked by countless hours of practice and dedication. I'm no stranger to competition, having clinched victory in numerous tournaments during my earlier years. But what drives me is the constant pursuit of improvement. Every day, I step onto the table with the goal of getting better, refining my skills, and pushing my limits.
